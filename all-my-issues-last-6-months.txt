Title: Look for more related topics and write matching new pages

Use the Google Search Console data to see what topics this site already ranks well for.  Then use a KeywordsEverywhere People Also Search For (PASF) tool to find additional related queries.  Keep going until you have a list of topics that are relevant and related to the central topic of the site but which are not explicitly covered, covered in detail, or have dedicated pages. Based on that draft a list of high priority new pages to create, then create those pages using research tools to get background and specific facts. Focus on topics that have high CPC and balance that with high Volume and moderate competition.

For example if a website is about Strawberries it might rank for the query [strawberry plants], but the KeywordsEverywhere tool shows that people also search for [do strawberry plants need direct sunlight], and from this you can see that an article "How to ensure your Strawberry plants get sufficient sunlight for a sweet crop!" would be a good article you can then write.

Address the underlying intent, need, pain points, of the reader to ensure that the new pages fully satisfy them.

Title: Xml fact file

In the .private directory make a fact file. Use xml.  Make the first entry an example,  use BNF style to show options.

Include an id , the fact, the source , fact check status, etc.

Then for each fact, fact check it using Tavily search and extract. Update the fact file with status, source citation as a url,  date checked.

Add any extra fields that seems reasonable in order to help ensure accuracy of this travel guide website. The fact file will be used for updating .

Get the proposed facts by scanning the existing html files, then fact check and later on edit and improve the site.

Cheung Chau is an island is a fact. There are many seafood restaurants there is a fact. It is a fun place is an opinion,  not a fact. Vegetarian food is available during Bun Festival is a fact. It is exciting is an opinion, not a fact.

Title: XML fact file

**Instruction:**

You are tasked with creating and maintaining a rigorously fact-checked, high-quality informational website. Begin by scanning all existing HTML content to extract **proposed factual claims**ÔÇösuch as locations, activities, services, events, and amenitiesÔÇöwhile filtering out opinions, subjective language, or promotional content.  

In the `.private` directory, create a **fact file** named `facts.xml` using XML format. The first entry must be a well-structured **example** written in **BNF-like syntax** to illustrate acceptable formats and required fields.  

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!--
BNF Grammar for Fact File Structure:

<fact-file> ::= "<facts>" <fact>* "</facts>"
<fact> ::= "<fact id=\"" <id> "\">" 
           <fact-statement> 
           <source> 
           <category> 
           <fact-check-status> 
           <verification-details>? 
           <metadata> 
           "</fact>"

<id> ::= <string>                    <!-- Unique identifier -->
<fact-statement> ::= "<statement>" <text> "</statement>"
<source> ::= "<source>" <url-or-file> "</source>"
<category> ::= "<category>" ( "geography" | "food" | "culture" | "transportation" | "events" | "accommodation" | "recreation" | "history" | "economy" ) "</category>"
<fact-check-status> ::= "<status>" ( "unverified" | "verified" | "false" | "partially-true" | "disputed" ) "</status>"
<verification-details> ::= "<verification>" 
                          <verification-url>? 
                          <date-checked> 
                          <checked-by> 
                          <confidence-level> 
                          <notes>? 
                          "</verification>"
<metadata> ::= "<metadata>" 
               <created-date> 
               <last-updated> 
               <importance-level> 
               <tourist-relevance> 
               "</metadata>"

```

Adjust the XML structure as necessary, adding new fields and tags that are relevant to this case is fine. The XML structure is a framework, not a iron clad rule.

 Use **Tavily Search and Extract** to independently verify every proposed fact. Update the XML file with:  
 - Verified `citation_url` from authoritative sources  
 - Accurate `date_checked` (use current system date; correct any outdated entries)  
 - Appropriate `status` based on verification outcome  

 Expand your research to ensure comprehensive coverage:  
 - Include **all named restaurants** or similar things such as **shops**, **museums**, **businesses**, verifying existence, cuisine, availability (especially during events like the Bun Festival)  
 - Cover **beaches** or similar such as **parks**, **promenades**, **photo locations**, including names, accessibility, facilities, safety  
 - Include **recreational activities** (e.g., windsurfing, kayaking, bike rentals, wine tasting, people watching)  
 - Verify **event dates, durations, and cultural significance**  
 - Add any other tourist-relevant categories missing from initial scans  

 After completing the fact-checking phase, use the verified `facts.xml` and supporting research files in `.private` to **enhance the website**:  
 - Edit, rewrite, and expand pages for accuracy, depth, and usefulness  
 - Add new sections or pages where gaps exist  
 - Ensure content is detailed, engaging, and helpfulÔÇötransforming raw facts into compelling, trustworthy visitor guidance  
 - It is good to express opinion, but combine them or use them as an adjunct to facts  
 - Prioritize high CPC terms, topics with a good combination of high volume and moderate competition.
 - In your writing focus on readability, clarity, structure, and user experience. Use full evocative sensorial language, write full expressive paragraphs but keep vocabulary to middle school level. Break up walls of text with call out boxes, "tips", "recommendations" etc as well as lists, emojis and links to other resources both internal and external.

 The final website edots should make the site even more be impressively informative, meticulously accurate, and clearly superior to its previous versionÔÇöserving as a reliable resource for travelers.

Title: Yellowstone National Park Website Enhancement: Comprehensive Action Plan

## Objective

This issue sets out a **detailed, step-by-step improvement plan** for the Yellowstone National Park static website in the private repository `raymondlowe/yellowstone-national-park.com`. The goal is to maximize site usefulness, SEO performance, and commercial value, while ensuring robust content coverage and technical correctness. This plan is designed for the Copilot Agent with access to keywordseverywhere and tavily MCP servers.

## 1. **Initial Content \& Coverage Audit**

- **Review all existing `.html` pages:** Catalogue covered topics, noting page purpose, target audience, and last update.
- **List sitewide topics/themes currently covered:** E.g., attractions, geysers, hiking, wildlife, lodging, photography, camping, park map, safety, weather, visitor centers, trip planning guides, tours, technology, crowd avoidance, etc.
- **Identify outdated content and gaps:** Prioritize anything with 2024/older data or poor depth; note missing visitor tips, annual changes, or new features.


## 2. **Keyword \& Commercial Opportunity Analysis**

**A. Identify Existing SEO Presence**

- Use the keywordseverywhere server to:
    - Pull the exact keywords each major site page and the overall domain currently rank for.
    - Get rank positions, traffic estimates, search volume, and Click-Per-Cost (CPC) values for these keywords.

**B. Analyze Related \& High-Value Keywords**

- Gather lists of:
    - Related search queries and "People Also Search For" keywords.
    - High-CPC and high-search-volume keywords, especially for commercial value (e.g., lodging, tour bookings, packages, campground reservations).
- Pay attention to seasonal trends, destination-specific phrases, and emerging traveler questions.
- Record CPC and volume for each relevant keyword found.


## 3. **Action Plan for Content Enhancement**

### A. Enhance Existing Pages

For each important current page:

- Evaluate and list ways to:
    - Expand depth and detail (e.g., more current data, rich visitor information).
    - Add FAQ sections to address "People also ask" queries.
    - Identify opportunities to embed or link to new, related high-CPC topic pages.
    - Ensure meta tags (description, keywords) are present and feature target keywords.
- Where content is stale, update with 2025 or latest available information.


### B. Create High-Impact New Pages

For **each** high-value keyword or new user need:

- Map out new page ideas targeting:
    - Commercial topics (e.g., "Yellowstone family vacation packages 2025", "Yellowstone RV camping tips", "Yellowstone private tours", "Yellowstone weather by month", "Yellowstone road closures/live reports").
    - Underrepresented visitor interests or trending search questions.
- **For each new page:**
    - Copy `inside.dwt` to create the initial HTML file.
    - Only edit within "\#BeginEditable" / "\#EndEditable" regions (`doctitle`, `meta_description`, and `content`).
    - Use strong SEO-optimized titles and meta descriptions.
    - Populate the content block with comprehensive, well-structured information, optimized for the identified keyword and user intent.
    - Ensure new pages are included in navigation or well-linked from relevant existing pages.


### C. Internal Linking Strategy

- Audit for "orphan" pages (no internal links in/out); ensure each page is linked to from at least one prominent spot (nav menu, sidebar, within context in another page).
- Update nav menus and footer links in `inside.dwt` if required.
- Add in-text links between related or complementary pages to improve user flow and SEO signal.


## 4. **Technical \& Functional Quality Control**

- **Page Rendering:** Check each `.html` page for proper display and correct layout in common browsers.
- **Navigation Consistency:** Ensure all new and updated pages appear in the siteÔÇÖs main menus and footer as appropriate.
- **Template Usage:**
    - Never modify content outside of Dreamweaver "EditableRegion" areas in any file.
    - Do not alter `inside.dwt` except for: global navigation/footer updates, style tweaks, required structural changes. Document any modifications made.
    - All new pages must use `inside.dwt` as the template; copy then edit as described.
- **Meta and SEO Checks:** Confirm all pages have appropriate meta descriptions and keywords, especially newly targeted ones.


## 5. **Deployment Self-Check**

- The site deploys to Cloudflare Pages via GitHub Hooks. Before closing this issue:
    - Confirm that all builds are green and the deployed site is functional.
    - Spot-check the public site for broken links, 404s, or navigation issues after changes.
    - Review Google Search Console or any error reporting in Cloudflare (if available) for crawl or indexing issues post-update.


## 6. **Reporting and Documentation**

- Track every substantive change in clear commit messages, referencing this issue.
- Summarize:
    - All new pages created (listing file names and target keywords).
    - Major enhancements and updates to existing pages.
    - Any global template (`inside.dwt`) or navigation changes.
    - Technical issues fixed (if any).
- Optionally, update or add a `/docs/WEBSITE-IMPROVEMENT.md` or similar summary as a persistent project log for maintainers[^2].


## 7. **Potential Failure Modes \& Cautions**

- **Never** edit content outside Dreamweaver `#BeginEditable`/`#EndEditable` regionsÔÇö**violations will break template rendering**.
- All new pages must be initialized from `inside.dwt`.
- DonÔÇÖt create orphaned contentÔÇöall pages must be linked from some user path.
- When touching global navigation, ensure full coverage across all `.html` files by using the template system.
- All content updates must cite or reference the current year (2025), especially for guide/seasonal information.


### **Tasks Checklist**

Another hole has formed at Yellowstone National Park, geologists say

Another hole has formed at Yellowstone National Park, geologists sayBeneath Yellowstone National Park lies a complex and extensive volcanic system.
More geological changes are occurring at Yellowstone National Park, as another hole forms in one of the park's basins.

The hole is a blue water spring, discovered by geologists in April as they conducted routine maintenance of temperature logging stations at Norris Geyser Basin, according to the [U.S. Geological Survey](https://www.usgs.gov/observatories/yvo/news/another-new-hole-ground-norris-geyser-basin).

The pool, located in the Porcelain Basin sub-basin west of a patch of vegetation known as "Tree Island," was not there during their last visit to the area in the fall, according to the USGS.

The water is light blue in color and is about 1 foot deep below the rim. It's geological features indicate it formed as a result of a [hydrothermal explosion](https://www.usgs.gov/observatories/yvo/news/hydrothermal-explosions-a-worldwide-phenomena) -- an event caused by pressure changes that result from the transition of liquid water to steam, according to the USGS.

The pool measures about 13 feet in diameter and is surrounded by numerous small rocks about 1 foot across. The rocks are covered by light gray, sandy mud.

It is "not surprising" that a hydrothermal explosion occurred at the site, as it has happened several times in recent decades, according to the USGS. The North Geyser Basin is the "most dynamic" area in Yellowstone, the agency said.

High-resolution satellite imagery indicates that the hole was not present on Dec. 19, but images taken on Jan. 6 show a depression that had formed in the area. By Feb. 13, the pool had been filled with water, the satellite images show.

More hydrothermal explosions will likely be recorded, as a monitoring station installed in 2023 can detect geophysical data indicating an explosion.

In April 2024, a "small" explosion at the Porcelain Terrace left a crater measuring several feet across in diameter, according to the [USGS](https://www.usgs.gov/observatories/yvo/news/a-small-hydrothermal-explosion-norris-geyser-basin).

A hole that formed in Yellowstone's Biscuit Basin, near Old Faithful, in July 2024 was also attributed to a hydrothermal explosion, according to the [National Park Service](https://www.nps.gov/yell/learn/news/240723.htm).

While that hole likely formed in a single major explosive event, the newest thermal feature appears to have formed by multiple small events that initially threw rocks but later threw silica mud a short distance, creating a small pit that became filled with silica-rich water.

Geologists estimate that the feature probably started to develop on Dec. 25, with further activity occurring through late January and early February, according to the USGS.

Beneath Yellowstone National Park lies a complex and extensive volcanic system. The park is thoroughly monitored by the USGS and the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory.

Title: XML fact file

**Instruction:**

You are tasked with creating and maintaining a rigorously fact-checked, high-quality informational website. Begin by scanning all existing HTML content to extract **proposed factual claims**ÔÇösuch as locations, activities, services, events, and amenitiesÔÇöwhile filtering out opinions, subjective language, or promotional content.  

In the `.private` directory, create a **fact file** named `facts.xml` using XML format. The first entry must be a well-structured **example** written in **BNF-like syntax** to illustrate acceptable formats and required fields.  

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!--
BNF Grammar for Fact File Structure:

<fact-file> ::= "<facts>" <fact>* "</facts>"
<fact> ::= "<fact id=\"" <id> "\">" 
           <fact-statement> 
           <source> 
           <category> 
           <fact-check-status> 
           <verification-details>? 
           <metadata> 
           "</fact>"

<id> ::= <string>                    <!-- Unique identifier -->
<fact-statement> ::= "<statement>" <text> "</statement>"
<source> ::= "<source>" <url-or-file> "</source>"
<category> ::= "<category>" ( "geography" | "food" | "culture" | "transportation" | "events" | "accommodation" | "recreation" | "history" | "economy" ) "</category>"
<fact-check-status> ::= "<status>" ( "unverified" | "verified" | "false" | "partially-true" | "disputed" ) "</status>"
<verification-details> ::= "<verification>" 
                          <verification-url>? 
                          <date-checked> 
                          <checked-by> 
                          <confidence-level> 
                          <notes>? 
                          "</verification>"
<metadata> ::= "<metadata>" 
               <created-date> 
               <last-updated> 
               <importance-level> 
               <tourist-relevance> 
               "</metadata>"

```

Adjust the XML structure as necessary, adding new fields and tags that are relevant to this case is fine. The XML structure is a framework, not a iron clad rule.

 Use **Tavily Search and Extract** to independently verify every proposed fact. Update the XML file with:  
 - Verified `citation_url` from authoritative sources  
 - Accurate `date_checked` (use current system date; correct any outdated entries)  
 - Appropriate `status` based on verification outcome  

 Expand your research to ensure comprehensive coverage:  
 - Include **all named restaurants** or similar things such as **shops**, **museums**, **businesses**, verifying existence, cuisine, availability (especially during events like the Bun Festival)  
 - Cover **beaches** or similar such as **parks**, **promenades**, **photo locations**, including names, accessibility, facilities, safety  
 - Include **recreational activities** (e.g., windsurfing, kayaking, bike rentals, wine tasting, people watching)  
 - Verify **event dates, durations, and cultural significance**  
 - Add any other tourist-relevant categories missing from initial scans  

 After completing the fact-checking phase, use the verified `facts.xml` and supporting research files in `.private` to **enhance the website**:  
 - Edit, rewrite, and expand pages for accuracy, depth, and usefulness  
 - Add new sections or pages where gaps exist  
 - Ensure content is detailed, engaging, and helpfulÔÇötransforming raw facts into compelling, trustworthy visitor guidance  
 - It is good to express opinion, but combine them or use them as an adjunct to facts  
 - Prioritize high CPC terms, topics with a good combination of high volume and moderate competition.
 - In your writing focus on readability, clarity, structure, and user experience. Use full evocative sensorial language, write full expressive paragraphs but keep vocabulary to middle school level. Break up walls of text with call out boxes, "tips", "recommendations" etc as well as lists, emojis and links to other resources both internal and external.

 The final website edots should make the site even more be impressively informative, meticulously accurate, and clearly superior to its previous versionÔÇöserving as a reliable resource for travelers.
